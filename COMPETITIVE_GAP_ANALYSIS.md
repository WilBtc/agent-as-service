        pass

    async def handle_request(self, request):
        """Handle MCP requests from agents"""
        pass

# Integration with existing agents
class ClaudeAgent:
    def __init__(self, ..., mcp_server: Optional[MCPServer] = None):
        self.mcp_server = mcp_server
```

**Impact**:
- ✅ Interoperability with other MCP-compatible systems

    """Lead agent that coordinates worker agents"""

    def __init__(self, lead_model="claude-opus-4", worker_model="claude-sonnet-4"):
        self.lead_model = lead_model
        self.worker_model = worker_model
        self.workers = []

    async def spawn_workers(self, task: str, num_workers: int = 3):
        """Spawn parallel worker agents"""
        subtasks = await self.lead.decompose_task(task)

        workers = []
        for subtask in subtasks:
            worker = await self.create_worker(subtask)
            workers.append(worker)

        return await asyncio.gather(*[w.execute() for w in workers])
```

**New Agent Type**:
